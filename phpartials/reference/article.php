	<h2>Article</h2>
	<p>The article is one of the most important pieces of content layout on the web today. Any large section of thematically related text can be considered an article. From the W3C spec:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
