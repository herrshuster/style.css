				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>With the advent of CSS frameworks as a standard contention in the web industry, there has been an explosion of classism. That is to say, markup on the web is littered with classes like <code>col-12-3</code>, <code>tiny button</code>, and others. These classes are usually hooks into the applied CSS framework, like Foundation, Bootstrap, or Gumby. This makes it very easy for web developers to quickly prototype designs without having to go through and build each element.</p>
				<p>However, this ruins the semantics of the web <a href="semantics.html">(Read More Here)</a>The Semantic CSS Framework tries to put that right. The entire codebase uses semantic selectors to style as many elements as conceivable. Its philosophy maintains that if a pattern appears unique to a user, there is a way to define that pattern in CSS with as few classes as possible.</p>

			<h3>No More Classism!</h3>
			
			
			<h3><small>Design Patterns</small></h3>
			<p>The answer to this problem is design patterns. Users will never see <code>button class="tiny round"</code>," or <code>figure class="carousel"</code>, but they will see a button at the end of a contact form, and they will see an image carousel. The markup for each distinct visual element will usually follow a unique pattern. For instance, a <code>figure > ol > li x 10 > img</code> is inherently a slideshow. There is no other conceivable visual element that will be a series of ordered images inside a figure. Therefore, why use classes? They can be helpful for rapid prototyping, but serve no purpose in deployment.</p>
			<p>The Semantic CSS Framework is based on these design patterns. Its philosophy is that 99% of all conceivable elements can be selected in CSS using these design patterns. There are a number of classes, but they are semantic. By this I mean that any class names not only describe the visual appearance of the element, but also its function &amp; content. For instance, "row" is a fairly semantic class name IF it is only used to describe a group of elements whose width is 100%. <code>section.colophon</code> is also semantic, as there is no colophon element, but colophons are to be displayed differently than other footer text. <code>article > aside.author</code> behaves in a similar fashion.</p>
